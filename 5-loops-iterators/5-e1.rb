# What does the each method in the following program 
# return after it is finished executing?

# x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# x.each do |a|
#   a + 1
# end

# The each method adds 1 to each of the integers stored in the array known as 'x'.

## ==> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
## ==> "each returns the original array it was called on."
